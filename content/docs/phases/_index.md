The framework is simple. It begins by designing a shared vision for sustainable technology with key stakeholders in tech, including CTOs, product managers, developers, testers, and others. Next, it progresses to mapping the current reality of unsustainable practices using systems mapping tools like causal loop diagrams. The creative tension between this vision and the existing reality is crucial, and the framework encourages tech teams to work towards the vision. Once the current reality is accurately mapped, teams identify leverage pointsâ€”areas where interventions can deliver the highest impact. Subsequently, brainstorming and designing interventions to bridge the gap between the vision and current reality take place. After finalizing these interventions and allocating budgets and resources, departmental and individual goals and action plans are created, aligned with quantified objectives. The objecitves are then evaluated; successes and learnings are reported, driving further iteration by reiterating both the vision and the current reality to continuously improve outcomes.
