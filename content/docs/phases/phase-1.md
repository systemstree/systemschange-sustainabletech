## Objective

To collaboratively articulate a unified vision, core values, and purpose for technology, with sustainability as the central guiding principle.


## Process

To cultivate a comprehensive approach to sustainability, convene a one-day workshop encompassing representatives from diverse departments: CTOs, product managers, developers, testers, and essential stakeholders. This cross-functional representation ensures a holistic perspective on sustainability within the tech landscape, and also brings a common consensus and commitment to achieving the vision. 

- **Vision for sustainable tech:**: Craft a vision statement that aligns with both the overarching organizational vision and established ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) targets. Operationalize key terms within the vision through clear definitions and examples to ensure everyone comprehends its meaning and implications for sustainable practices. 

- **Values as guiding principles:**: Identify and operationalize core values that directly support the sustainability vision. This involves defining these values in a way that resonates with every team member, fostering a shared understanding and commitment to ethical and responsible technology development. 


- **A purpose driven by sustainability:**: Develop a purpose statement that articulates why the tech team exists within this broader context. Explicitly link this purpose to sustainability, emphasizing the team's contribution to a better future through responsible innovation.


## Report

Publish a report that includes the collaboratively defined vision, core values, and purpose for technology within the organization. It serves as a guiding document for all team members involved in developing and deploying technology solutions.
