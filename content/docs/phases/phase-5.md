## Objective

Design goals and action plan for individual interventions identified in phase-4. This phase focuses on establishing specific, time-bound, and quantifiable goals coupled with a detailed roadmap for implementation, ensuring progress can be tracked and success evaluated.


## Process

Following process can be followed to design goals and action plan to work on the interventions

- **Goal/s derivation from interventions:** Translate the vision into SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals directly linked to the interventions identified in Phase 4. Each goal should address a critical aspect of moving towards sustianable tech within the organization.

- **Impact variable focus:** Prioritize goals directly tied to the most crucial impact variables. These variables will serve as primary indicators of progress towards the desired sustainable future.

- **Baseline & target setting:** Establish clear baselines for each impact variable, capturing current performance data. Set ambitious yet realistic targets for improvement within a defined timeframe (e.g., 3-5 years), ensuring continuous progress.
 
- **Action plan development:** For each goal, develop a detailed action plan outlining specific tasks, responsible parties, timelines, resources required, and success metrics. Break down larger goals into manageable sub-tasks for effective execution.

- **Stakeholder alignment & ownership:** Facilitate workshops involving key stakeholders (leadership, departments, sustainability team) to ensure buy-in, clarify roles, and foster a sense of collective ownership over the goals and action plan.
