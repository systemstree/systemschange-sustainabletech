title: Phase-3 [Identify leverages for greatest impact]
description: >
  By analyzing the systems map from Phase 2, this phase allows participants to identify critical "leverage points" areas where targeted interventions will yield the most significant positive impact on achieving sustainable tech goals.

## Objective

 To collaboratively identify the most impactful intervention points (leverages) within the constructed CLD. 


## Process

 Building upon the completed CLD, engage all workshop participants who contributed to its creation in a focused exercise guided by Donella Meadows' approach towards identifying leverage points (in increasing order of effectiveness).

- **12. Constants, parameters, numbers (such as subsidies, taxes, standards):** Advocate for policy changes and incentives that support sustainable tech development and penalize unsustainable practices. In sustainable tech, subsidies incentivize green innovation, while taxes penalize unsustainable practices, creating a level playing field. Stringent standards set eco-friendly benchmarks, driving market shifts and consumer demand. 

- **11. The sizes of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows:** By carefully balancing the stocks (renewable storage, recycled materials, resilient ecosystems) against continuous flows (energy consumption, material extraction, emissions), sustainable tech can operate without depleting finite resources and destabilizing the environment.

- **10. The structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport networks, population age structures):** This leverage point asks us to decouple growth from environmental depletion.

- **9. The lengths of delays, relative to the rate of system change:** Accelerate the adoption of sustainable practices by reducing delays such as bureaucratic hurdles, regulatory bottlenecks, and approvals (e.g., swiftly transitioning to renewable-powered cloud infrastructure).

- **8. The strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the impacts they are trying to correct against:** Enhance feedback mechanisms to course-correct unsustainable practices more effectively. Monitor and adjust based on real-time environmental impact data.

- **7. The gain around driving positive feedback loops:** Strengthen existing positive loops driving sustainable outcomes (e.g., green software adoption, circularity initiatives)

- **6. The structure of information flows (who does and does not have access to information):** Ensure transparent and accessible data on environmental impact throughout the tech lifecycle. Promote data-driven decision making for sustainability.

- **5. The rules of the system (such as incentives, punishments, constraints):** Design policies, rewards, and regulations that incentivize sustainable practices and disincentivize unsustainable ones within software development, data center operations, and resource consumption.

- **4. The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure:** Cultivate the ability for sustainable tech systems to self-organize and evolve, enabling continuous adaptation, innovation, and progress toward ambitious sustainability goals.

- **3. The goals of the system:** Clearly define and consistently reinforce sustainability-focused goals that directly align with the vision and values established in Phase 1, guiding the organization toward a sustainable future.

- **2. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system, its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters, arises:** Move away from focusing only on quick profits and embrace a long-term vision that prioritizes both people and the planet in all sustainable tech choices.

- **1. The power to transcend paradigms:** Challenge deeply ingrained assumptions (mental models) about technology's role and sustainability within the organization and broader industry. Explore alternative visions and values.
