## Objective

To collaboratively identify the most impactful interventions, for the leverages that are identified in phase-3. 
 

## Process

These steps guide the development of effective interventions within critical leverage points.

- **Prioritize leverage points:** Based on data gathered in previous phases (Vision/Values/Purpose, current reality, identified leverages), design interventions that work on those leverages. 

- **Solution design workshop:** Engage cross-functional teams (tech, operations, policy, sustainability experts) in a collaborative workshop to come up with multiple interventions per leverage point.

- **Select & refine interventions:** Choose the most promising interventions based on projected impact, feasibility, and alignment with organizational values. Further refine selected interventions, detailing implementation plans, resource allocation, and success measurement frameworks.

## Note

The above steps can be customized according to your needs. In future releases we will document the tools you can use to list and rank interventions.
