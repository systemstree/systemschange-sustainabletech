## Objective

 To collaboratively construct a understanding of technology's current sustainability reality through the lens of causal loop diagrams (CLDs), revealing interconnected impacts across its lifecycle. This exercise moves beyond isolated issues and encourages a holistic view of systemic challenges and opportunities.


## Process

 Employing a systems-thinking approach, we will utilize CLDs as the primary tool throughout a structured workshop with four key stages:


- **Foundation: Defining the Tech Ecosystem:** Begin by sketching out the entire lifecycle of technology, explicitly incorporating unsustainable software practices:

  * **Extraction & manufacturing:** While acknowledging physical resource extraction, emphasize the "software footprint." Analyze data center location choices and energy consumption tied to fossil fuels. Discuss embodied carbon in software development and updates.
  
  * **Unsustainable algorithms and data processing::** Highlight computationally intensive algorithms including excessive energy use in training AI  models, leading to increased carbon emissions. Map out the lifecycle of data storage and processing, revealing hotspots for inefficiency and environmental impact.

  * **Distribution and use (Software-centric impacts):** Go beyond physical products to include the energy consumed by constant app updates, cloud services, and user behavior influenced by resource-heavy features.
        
  * **End-of-life (software obsolescence):** Discuss planned obsolescence in software, leading to frequent upgrades and e-waste generation indirectly linked to hardware replacements. 


- **Key Themes Identification:**: Highlight critical sustainability themes emerging from each lifecycle stage (e.g., biodiversity loss, carbon emissions, social inequity). 

- **Building the CLDs:** In small groups, construct separate CLDs focusing on specific themes identified.
