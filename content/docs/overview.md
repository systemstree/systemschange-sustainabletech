## Guiding objectives

The following objectives guide the framework

- **Systemic structure for sustainable interventions:**: Provide a robust framework incorporating the principles of systems thinking to design impactful interventions that directly address the root causes of unsustainable practices in technology. This involves using tools like mental models and causal loop diagrams to understand complex interrelationships within the tech ecosystem and pinpoint leverage points for maximum positive change.


- **Empowering action and project implementation:**: Equip organizations with practical tools and workshops to translate sustainability vision into actionable projects grounded in regenerative principles. The framework aims not  just to minimize harm but actively contribute to restoring and enhancing natural resources and social equity through technology.


- **Continuous improvement and learning:**: The framework fosters a culture of continuous learning and adaptation, incorporating feedback loops and iterative improvements to move towards ever-increasing sustainability outcomes.


## Application

The systems change framework offers a structured approach to guide organizations towards a sustainable tech future. This framework goes beyond individual initiatives, aiming for systemic change throughout the technology ecosystem. By working collaboratively and leveraging this structured, regenerative approach, tech teams can build a more sustainable and equitable technological future.

It applies universally to:

- **Tech companies:**: Driving responsible innovation and minimizing environmental impact within product development and operations.

- **IT Service providers:**: Integrating sustainability principles into service offerings and client engagements.

- **Internal IT teams:** Embedding sustainability across all IT functions within diverse businesses, fostering a culture of responsible tech use that aligns with the organizational vision, values and purpose.
