Welcome to the repository of the Systems Change for Sustainable Tech Framework!

This repository hosts the documentation and blueprint for a systems change framework dedicated to driving sustainable technology adoption. Centered around a continuous circular process, this framework empowers organizations to transition towards responsible and sustainable technological development.

## The six phases

The iterative systems change framework has six phases and is designed to help organizations to create a shared vision for sustainable tech and provide a structured approach to achieve that vision.

- Phase 1: Build a Shared Vision for Sustainable Tech.
- Phase 2: Map current reality of unsustainable tech using systems map.
- Phase 3: Identify leverages for greatest impact.
- Phase 4: Design interventions to reduce the gap between vision and current reality.
- Phase 5: Create quantified goals and action plan.
- Phase 6: Evaluate the progress and report success and learnings.
